How I Set Up Foundry with WSL and VS Code on Windows
Step 1: Install WSL

Open the Command Prompt and type:
"wsl --install"
Restart your computer.
Step 2: Set Up Ubuntu

After restarting, WSL will open and check if you have Ubuntu. If you don’t have Ubuntu, you can download it [here](https://ubuntu.com/).
Create a username and password (note: you will not be able to see your password when typing).
Step 3: Install VS Code

Make sure you have Visual Studio Code (VS Code) downloaded. If not, you can download it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
Note: If you want to use VS Code without the Microsoft license, perhaps for a project or code you don’t want them having access to, you can use VSCodium.
Step 4: Open VS Code and Terminal

Open VS Code.
Open a terminal by going to View at the top and selecting Terminal, or press Ctrl + .
Step 5: Access WSL in VS Code

In the terminal, type:
"wsl"
This will put you right into the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
Step 6: Change Directory

To change the directory where you want your files to go (for example, if you want it to open in the D: drive instead of C:), type:
"cd D:"
Step 7: Install Foundry

Download Foundry by typing:
"curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash"
To run Foundry, type:
"foundryup"
